# AOC 2021

Having fun with this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

I am using Python and Jupyter Notebook for this.

## Input Files
I use the request library to get the input data from the website. Since input data varies for users, you will need your cookie. I save the cookie in the `secrets.txt` file in the root.

Here is what the `secrets.txt` file looks like:

```python
[session_info]
cookie=YOUR_COOKIE_HERE
```
